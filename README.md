##Find the best tv shows thanks to Python

I always have the feeling that I spend more time in the menus of the streaming apps, rather than actually watching an episodes of a new TV series. Plus, I started re-watching my favourite shows because I struggling in finding good new ones.

So i decided to use my knowledge in Python (and Pandas) to looking for the best shows, thath each streaming services, can provide me. In this script the users needs only to type in the genre of the show they are interested in: the script will provide an excel file with a sheet for each streaming service.
