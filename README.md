# Find the best Tv Series thanks to Python

I always have the feeling that I spend more time in the menus of the streaming apps, rather than actually watching an episodes of a new TV series. Plus, I started re-watching my favourite shows because I struggling in finding good new ones.

So i decided to use my knowledge in Python (and Pandas) to looking for the best shows that each streaming services can provide me. In this script the users needs only to type in the genre of the show they are interested in: the script will provide an excel file with a sheet for each streaming service.

For this I used a dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney) but as it lacked the 'genres' feature i had to join it with a second one, directly downloaded from iMDB (https://datasets.imdbws.com/)
